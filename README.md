Do you know a rising star ⭐️✨ in the Fuel developer community? Nominate them as a Pioneer in the Fuel Developer Champions program! 🙌

This program seeks to empower Fuel developers and unlock their potential, to provide resources for them to level up their skills and to participate in the future development of Fuel. As a member of this program they will have access to dedicated opportunities to network, to learn, and to be mentored by leading devs in the Fuel community. They will also have the chance to showcase their work and to help others in the community. Let's not forget also access to exclusive merch based on their level and contributions!

Show your appreciation for a rising dev in the Fuel community, by [creating a new nomination for them]https://github.com/fuel-champions/nominate-a-pioneer/issues/new/choose().

The requirements for entry into the Pioneer stage are:

* Experience in web3
* Interest in building on Fuel
* Proof of code contributions to open source web3 projects, not necessarily Fuel, but it's a plus
* Agreement to abide by the [Fuel Developer Champions Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fuel-champions/code-of-conduct)

Once you have submitted your nomination, the Fuel team will review it and respond with next steps.
